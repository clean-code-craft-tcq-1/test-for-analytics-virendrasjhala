# Test for Analytics

Design tests for Analytics functionality on a Battery Monitoring System.

Fill the parts marked '_enter' in the **Tasks** section below.

## Analysis-functionality to be tested

This section lists the Analysis for which _tests_ must be written.

Battery Telemetrics are collected and stored on a server.
Data for a month is stored in a [csv file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values).

Analysis must be done on this csv file to find the following:
- minimum
- maximum
- count of breaches (how many times did it cross the threshold in a month?)
- record trends (date & time when the reading was continuously increasing for 30 minutes)

A PDF report of the analysis must be stored every week.
Notification must be sent when a new report is available.

## Tasks

### List Dependencies

List the dependencies of the Analysis-functionality.

1. Access to the Server containing the telemetrics in a csv file
1. Access to the csv file (admin rights)
1. waiting time to access the file (time bound).

(add more if needed)

### Mark the System Boundary

What is included in the software unit-test? What is not? Fill this table.

| Item                      | Included?     | Reasoning / Assumption
|---------------------------|---------------|---
Battery Data-accuracy       | No            | We do not test the accuracy of data
Computation of maximum      | Yes           | This is part of the software being developed
Off-the-shelf PDF converter | No            | we can not change the functionality only test if working or not
Counting the breaches       | Yes           | we can check by mocking/stubb
Detecting trends            | Yes           | we can check if trend recorded or not
Notification utility        | Yes           | we can check on if notification sent or not

### List the Test Cases

Write tests in the form of `<expected output or action>` from `<input>` / when `<event>`

Add to these tests:

1. Write minimum and maximum to the PDF from a csv containing positive and negative readings
1. Write "Invalid input" to the PDF when the csv doesn't contain expected data
1. Write count of breach to the pdf from a csv containing the readings
1. write the recorded trends to the pdf from a csv file

### Recognize Fakes and Reality

Consider the tests for each functionality below.
In those tests, identify inputs and outputs.
Enter one part that's real and another part that's faked/mocked.

| Functionality            | Input        | Output                      | Faked/mocked part
|--------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|---
Read input from server     | csv file     | internal data-structure     | Fake the server store
Validate input             | csv data     | valid / invalid             | None - it's a pure function
Notify report availability |update variable|  bool                      | mock 
Report inaccessible server | csv file path |  bool                      | fake
Find minimum and maximum   | csv data     | bool                        | fake
Detect trend               | csv data     | bool                        | mock
Write to PDF               | csv analysed data | bool                   | mock
